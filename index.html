        <p>So this is my first blog post ever. I have considered doing one before but I suppose I needed a project like this to encourage me. I'm 42 years old and retired from the Navy last year. I decided to take a daring leap and earn a degree in Computer Science and become a web developer. There were many reasons I chose this path, freedom to work from anywhere, I always wanted to go to college, and I'll technically be a scientist. How cool is that!
        </p>
        <p>I knew there would be significant challenges doing this. I have a family I have to take care of, so working going to school full time, and being available for my family leaves me little downtime. My Summers off I play catch up with things that need to be done around the house. That's not to say I don't have somethings working in my favor. Support from my family, a developed work ethic, and an enthusiasm for what I'm learning. It's been a challenge so far, but I love it.</p>
        <p>Thats what brought me here to Khan Academy. I found the calculus courses to help me with my studies. I need a 3.75 GPA to be accepted into UW's program so any study material is a benefit. I still have 2 more quarters of calculus to go, plus physics so I'll probably be on here quite a bit in the future. Right now I have the summer off, and complete 2 quarters in Java. I wanted to continue my training with programming but wont see another class on it for another year. So I'm using the Summer to learn the course here since it's right in line with my goal of web development. I'd really like to start creating websites once I finish this Summer, mostly for practice and to develop a portfolio of work before I complete school.</p>
